Replit Project Prompt: Social Task & Event App
Create a web application that blends features from Uber, TaskRabbit, and TikTok, facilitating interactions between "Private" and "Public" user profiles.

Core User Types & Interactions
The application will feature two distinct user types:

Private Profiles:

Can create plan invitations for specific Public Profiles (date, time, price, per-invite chat).
Can create open invites that appear on Public Profiles' feeds. Public Profiles can then make offers to fulfill these invites. Private Profiles cannot see other Private Profiles' open invites.
Their profiles are not discoverable by other users. They are only visible to Public Profiles when viewing an invite from them.
Can add Public Profiles to their favorites.
On the Home feed, they can see "wish invites" created by Public Profiles.
Public Profiles:

Can accept or decline plan invitations from Private Profiles.
Can create posts that appear on the main feed for all other users.
Can see open invites from Private Profiles on their feed and make offers.
Are visible to Private Profiles for receiving invites.
On the Home feed, they can see available "Pals" (Public Profiles) or requests (open invites from Private Profiles).
User Registration & Authentication
Users must register with a unique username.
During registration, users must select their profile type: "Private" or "Public." Clearly state that Public profiles will be visible for receiving invites.
Users must also select their country and city during registration.
The bottom menu should be always available but require users to log in or register if they try to switch sections without being authenticated.
Application Sections & Functionality
The application should have the following main sections, accessible via a bottom menu:

Home (Feed)
For Public Profiles: Displays a feed of available "Pals" (other Public Profiles) and "Requests" (open invites from Private Profiles).
For Private Profiles: Displays a feed of "Wish Invites" created by Public Profiles.
Pals
Allows users to filter Public Profiles by their favorites.
Allows users to explore other Public Profiles.
Invites
Displays a list of invites categorized by their status:
Pending: Invites awaiting acceptance or decline.
Accepted: Invites that have been accepted.
Declined: Invites that have been declined.
My Profile & Edit
Displays the user's own profile information.
Allows users to edit their profile details.
Additional Notes:
Invites: All invites (plan invitations and open invites) should include a date, time, and price. A chat feature should be available for each individual plan invitation.
Data Storage: Consider how user data, posts, invites, and favorites will be stored (e.g., using a database).
User Interface (UI): Focus on a clean and intuitive UI that supports the described functionalities.
