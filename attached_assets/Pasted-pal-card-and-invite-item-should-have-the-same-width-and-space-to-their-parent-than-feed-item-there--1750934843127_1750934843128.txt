pal-card and invite-item should have the same width and space to their parent than feed-item, there is no padding effect between the parent container and the cards and that makes them to look to cramped

Looking at the CSS, I can see that the pal-card and invite-item don't have consistent padding with their parent containers like feed-item does. The issue is that these sections need proper padding to create breathing room between the container edges and the cards.

Let me fix this by adding consistent padding to the parent containers:

app/globals.css
Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update invites-list to work with section padding Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update invites-list to work with section padding Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update invites-list to work with section padding Update pals-grid to remove centering and let cards fill container naturally Update invites-list to work with section padding

The issue is that the parent sections (pals-grid and invites-list) need proper padding to create breathing room between the container edges and the cards, just like how the report-feed has padding for the feed-item cards.

Add proper padding to pals-grid and invites-list containers Add proper padding to pals-grid and invites-list containers Add proper padding to pals-grid and invites-list containers
